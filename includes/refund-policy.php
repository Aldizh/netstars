				<h4><strong>NeXXStars Partner Return Policy (U.S. & Canada Residents)</strong></h4>
				<p>
					If you voluntarily terminate the Partner Agreement, you may return Currently Marketable products in your inventory for a refund. You may only return products that you personally purchased from NeXXStars for resale (purchases from third parties are not subject to refund). “Currently Marketable” means that the products are returned within twelve (12) months of purchase and are in resalable condition; however, products shall not be Currently Marketable if returned for repurchase after the product’s commercially reasonable usable or shelf life period has passed; nor shall products be considered Currently Marketable if we clearly disclose to you prior to purchase that the products are seasonal, discontinued, or special promotion products and are not subject to the repurchase obligations. You must request an RMA number in order to return inventory and that RMA number must clearly be visible on the exterior of any package sent to NeXXStars for reimbursement calculations. Upon receipt of Currently Marketable products, we will reimburse you 90% of the net cost of the last purchase price(s) and 30% of all other orders returned in accordance to the Seventy Percent Rule (details listed in Section 6.1) or as otherwise required by law. Shipping and handling charges incurred by you when the products were purchased will not be refunded. Enrollment fee is non-refundable. 	
				</p>
				<p>
					B.2. REFUND OF PRODUCT – NO TERMINATION. If you are not 100% satisfied withour products, you may return them for a refund if neither you nor we have terminated the Partner Agreement and the products were purchased within thirty (30) days and are in resalable condition. The refund shall be at 90% of the last purchase price shipping and handling charges incurred by you when the products were purchased will not be refunded. If more than one order is returned within a six (6) month period the company may consider this an act of voluntary termination and terminate your Partner agreement.
				</p>
				<p>
					B.3. REFUSED PRODUCT. If you order products and then refuse delivery, your order will be subject to the restocking fee and other procedures for return therein, and we may charge you for the return shipping costs. If more than one order is refused within a six (6) month period the Company may consider this an act of voluntary termination and terminate your Partner Agreement. 
				</p>
				<p>B.4. REFUND PROCEDURES. To receive a refund, you must comply with the following:</p>
				<p>
					B.4.a. Obtain a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number by contacting our customer service department. This RMA number must be written on the exterior of each carton returned. RMAs are valid for thirty (30) days from the date of issue.
				</p>
				<p>
					B.4.b. Proper shipping carton(s) and packing materials are to be used in packaging the product(s) being returned for replacement. All returns must be shipped to NeXXStars pre-paid. NeXXStars does not accept shipping-collect packages. The risk of loss in shipping for returned product shall be borne by you. If returned product is not received by the Company’s distribution center, it is your responsibility to trace the shipment.
